                    There just isn't the space or even the need to use a wide display like the 16x2.<br> <br> Conveniently, these HD44780-based displays
                   
                    are made in a lot of different sizes. My favorite is the 8x2, sadly (at the
                   
                    expense of tiny I2C OLEDs), this one is often overlooked by the maker community. This means
                   
                    There wasn't a proper, dedicated backpack you could easily get for them.

                    An I2C backpack basically adapts the extensive parallel bus character displays use to the popular 2-wire I2C bus.
                   
                    This saves on a lot of wiring and precious IO pins on your microcontroller. And as a bonus, you can even share these
                   
                    2 wires between 127 more accessories!!!<br>
                   
                    Of course, nothing comes without a catch; using an I2C backpack will make the refresh rate of your display a little slower.
